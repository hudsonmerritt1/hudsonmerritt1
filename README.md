Hello!

Thank you for viewing my Rust Raid Decider project. This was a project I did for an exam grade in Business Programming 1 (I got an A for those wondering). 

This program helps Rust players decide if it is a smart idea to raid someone elses base and how many explosives they will need.

The boom_doors file is a comma delimited file that I used to store the amount of explosives neede for each door type.

I had a lot of fun building this and I hope it can help Rust players succeed in their upcoming raids.
